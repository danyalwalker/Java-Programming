/**
 * Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code. A lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around.
 * You can think of a lambda expression as an anonymous method. It has parameters and a body just like full-fledged methods do,
 * but it doesnâ€™t have a name like a real method. Lambda expressions are often referred to as lamb- das for short.
